For Windows, you can achieve the same functionality using PowerShell or a batch script. Here's a PowerShell script that downloads packages using `wget` (or `Invoke-WebRequest` if `wget` isn't available), caches them, and then installs from the cache:

### **PowerShell Script:**

### **Instructions:**
1. Open PowerShell and run:  
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser
   ```
2. Navigate to the script's location and run:  
   ```powershell
   .\install_packages.ps1
   ```

This setup ensures downloads can be resumed and cached, avoiding unnecessary re-downloads.
