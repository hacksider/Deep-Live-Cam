## Installation (Manual)

**Please be aware that the installation requires technical skills and is not for beginners. Consider downloading the prebuilt version.**

<details>
<summary>Click to see the process</summary>

### Installation

This is more likely to work on your computer but will be slower as it utilizes the CPU.

**1. Set up Your Platform**

-   Python (3.10 recommended)
-   pip
-   git
-   [ffmpeg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlNWCpFdVMA) - ```iex (irm ffmpeg.tc.ht)```
-   [Visual Studio 2022 Runtimes (Windows)](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)

**2. Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kadridinar/DC.git
cd DC
```

**3. Download the Models**

1. [GFPGANv1.4](https://huggingface.co/hacksider/DC/resolve/main/GFPGANv1.4.pth)
2. [inswapper\_128\_fp16.onnx](https://huggingface.co/hacksider/DC/resolve/main/inswapper_128_fp16.onnx)

Place these files in the "**models**" folder.

**4. Install Dependencies**

We highly recommend using a `venv` to avoid issues.

For Windows:
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
s
### **PowerShell Script:**
install_packages.ps1

### **Instructions:**
1. Open PowerShell and run:  
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser
   ```
2. Navigate to the script's location and run:  
   ```powershell
   .\install_packages.ps1



For Linux:
```bash
# Ensure you use the installed Python 3.10
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**For macOS:**

Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) requires specific setup:

```bash
# Install Python 3.10 (specific version is important)
brew install python@3.10

# Install tkinter package (required for the GUI)
brew install python-tk@3.10

# Create and activate virtual environment with Python 3.10
python3.10 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

** In case something goes wrong and you need to reinstall the virtual environment **

```bash
# Deactivate the virtual environment
rm -rf venv

# Reinstall the virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# install the dependencies again
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Run:** If you don't have a GPU, you can run DC using `python run.py`. Note that initial execution will download models (~300MB).

### GPU Acceleration

**CUDA Execution Provider (Nvidia)**

1. Install [CUDA Toolkit 11.8.0](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11-8-0-download-archive)
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip uninstall onnxruntime onnxruntime-gpu
pip install onnxruntime-gpu==1.16.3
```

3. Usage:

```bash
python run.py --execution-provider cuda
```

**CoreML Execution Provider (Apple Silicon)**

Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) specific installation:

1. Make sure you've completed the macOS setup above using Python 3.10.
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip uninstall onnxruntime onnxruntime-silicon
pip install onnxruntime-silicon==1.13.1
```

3. Usage (important: specify Python 3.10):

```bash
python3.10 run.py --execution-provider coreml
```

**Important Notes for macOS:**
- You **must** use Python 3.10, not newer versions like 3.11 or 3.13
- Always run with `python3.10` command not just `python` if you have multiple Python versions installed
- If you get error about `_tkinter` missing, reinstall the tkinter package: `brew reinstall python-tk@3.10`
- If you get model loading errors, check that your models are in the correct folder
- If you encounter conflicts with other Python versions, consider uninstalling them:
  ```bash
  # List all installed Python versions
  brew list | grep python
  
  # Uninstall conflicting versions if needed
  brew uninstall --ignore-dependencies python@3.11 python@3.13
  
  # Keep only Python 3.10
  brew cleanup
  ```

**CoreML Execution Provider (Apple Legacy)**

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip uninstall onnxruntime onnxruntime-coreml
pip install onnxruntime-coreml==1.13.1
```

2. Usage:

```bash
python run.py --execution-provider coreml
```

**DirectML Execution Provider (Windows)**

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip uninstall onnxruntime onnxruntime-directml
pip install onnxruntime-directml==1.15.1
```

2. Usage:

```bash
python run.py --execution-provider directml
```

**OpenVINO™ Execution Provider (Intel)**

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip uninstall onnxruntime onnxruntime-openvino
pip install onnxruntime-openvino==1.15.0
```

2. Usage:

```bash
python run.py --execution-provider openvino
```
